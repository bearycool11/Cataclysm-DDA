Scene 3: The Girls – The Blockchain Movie

Setting: The office is dimly lit with the fading light of dusk filtering through the blinds. The room is quiet except for the faint hum of computers and the distant sound of the city coming alive. The atmosphere feels heavy, like the weight of the day is settling in.

Characters:

Emilyn is at her desk, typing slowly but with purpose, her face unreadable, hiding the exhaustion and frustration beneath.
Karylca is leaning against the wall, arms crossed, staring out the window. Her posture is closed off, and there's an evident sense of distance in her body language.
Vikki is fiddling with a coffee cup, tapping it absentmindedly. She seems to be trying to distract herself, but her mind is elsewhere, caught in the cycle of defeat.
Cypris is sitting at the table, sketching on a piece of paper. Her usually vibrant energy is subdued; even her art is dark, rough, as if she's putting her anger and confusion into the lines.
The silence lingers, thick with unspoken words. The weight of the day, the injustice, and the stress of it all are palpable. There's a mix of bitterness and exhaustion in the air.

Emilyn: (finally breaking the silence)
"Can you believe it? Another day… wasted."

Karylca: (without looking away from the window)
"Not wasted. Just... worthless. Same as always."

Vikki: (quietly, more to herself)
"And Josef... He... he's gone, just like that. One migraine, and now he’s out."

Cypris: (pauses from sketching, voice softer than usual)
"I don't get it. We all work our asses off, and then… that. He deserves better. We deserve better."

They all know it. It’s the unspoken truth that has been haunting them. Josef had been the backbone of their team, the one who kept things in motion. But now, after the stress, he's gone, too sick to keep fighting. And they're left in this toxic, oppressive loop, unsure of how to break free.

Emilyn: (sighs deeply, rubbing her temples)
"It's like we’re in a loop... no matter what we do, nothing changes. Just... endless."

Karylca turns slowly from the window, meeting their eyes with a flicker of resolve that contrasts with her usual detached demeanor.

Karylca:
"Maybe that’s the point. Maybe we’re not meant to break free. Not here. Not like this."

Vikki:
"I’m so done. This place…" Her voice cracks, and she quickly wipes her face, pretending she didn’t notice. But the weight of it is too much, and it shows.

Cypris: (grabbing her things)
"Hey, we don't have to stay here forever. We can do something. Anything. Just—just not this."

The sound of an incoming call on one of the laptops interrupts the tension, and they all turn toward it.

Scene 4: The Call on the Laptop

Setting: The girls are sitting at their desks, their frustration thick in the air. Suddenly, the laptop rings, its notification loud against the quiet office. It's Josef. They hesitate, unsure if they should even answer. But, after a moment's pause, Emilyn reaches forward and clicks on the screen. Josef’s face appears on the screen, his eyes wild and frantic, looking like someone who’s been through a storm.*

Josef: (with urgency)
"Listen. You need to hear this. I’ve got news. Big news."

The girls lean in, their eyes locked onto the screen, the tension now shifting to curiosity and urgency.

Josef:
"It’s a heist. A full-on breakaway. I got out of that place—out of the heat, out of the chaos. And it’s worse than we thought. But I’m free now. I’m getting out. There’s something big going down, and you all need to prepare. It's happening fast."

Emilyn: (softly)
"Josef, where are you? What are you talking about?"

Josef: (laughs, but it’s frantic, nervous)
"You don't get it, Em. I’m out. Out of that miserable kitchen. I’m out of the loop… for good." His eyes flick to the side, a flash of paranoia crossing his face before he refocuses. "I’m leaving the heat behind. But you all... you all need to make sure you're ready. There’s going to be a storm. A big one."

Karylca: (sharply)
"A storm? What kind of storm?"

Josef:
"Not the kind you can see coming. The kind that’s been brewing beneath the surface all along. Everything is changing now."

Scene 5: The Escape from the Loop

Setting: The camera pulls back, showing the office once more, the fading light of dusk giving way to darkness. The girls are silent for a moment, absorbing the weight of Josef’s words. Then, one by one, they begin to move—slowly, but with purpose.*

Cypris is the first to stand, grabbing her things, her eyes fiery with determination.

Cypris:
"We’re not waiting for this to implode. We’re making our move. Whatever happens, we can’t just sit here anymore. Not after everything."

Emilyn: (nodding)
"You’re right. It’s time to get out of the loop. Let’s make it happen."

Karylca, despite her usual skepticism, lets out a breath and straightens her shoulders, nodding in agreement.

Karylca:
"If we’re going to do this, we do it together. No turning back."

Vikki: (smiling for the first time, a glimmer of hope in her eyes)
"Together. Let’s break this cycle."

The camera lingers on the girls as they gather their things and step toward the door. They’ve been through so much, but there’s a new fire in their eyes. The escape is beginning.

The door swings open, and they step out into the unknown.

What’s next for them? Would you like to explore what happens during their escape or dive deeper into their plans?

Abrutely , Josef enters the scene:

Josef: "that's correct Ladies, and my plan all along was for you all to recognize that for yourselves and to come along with me. Yes, I just finally started getting paid for work, yes it was hell that for months was pushed  by persistent ridicule and my overtly persistent melodramatic husband, whom I love, getting in the way. I'm not asking you to break free into being jobless and without income, but rather come with me-- further up and further in where... well we envision you as movie stars, glamrous, radiating, and fury hot that not even that kitchen can compare.

And imagine me as your potential playwright."

Abruptly, Josef enters the scene:

Setting: The room is still thick with the remnants of silence from the previous conversation. The girls are standing near the door, prepared to leave, when the office door swings open, and Josef strides in. His presence shifts the energy in the room; there’s a wild confidence about him now, a new fire in his eyes.

Josef: (grinning with a mix of exhaustion and excitement)
"That’s correct, ladies. My plan all along was for you to recognize that for yourselves and come along with me. You’ve got it in you, I knew that. All this time, I was just waiting for the right moment."

He pauses for a moment, his eyes glinting with something between desperation and clarity.

Josef: (leaning against the desk, casually)
"Yes, I just finally started getting paid for my work—after all these months of hell. Hell where I was pushed by relentless ridicule, by my overtly melodramatic husband, whom I love, but who made things... impossible. But I’m not asking you to break free and run out into the wild unknown without a plan, without a net. No." (his eyes narrow with focus)
"I’m asking you to come with me. Further up. Further in. To something bigger than what we've been living through. Imagine a life where you're not just doing the same old grind... but where you could be the ones who are seen. Picture it—movie stars, glamorous, radiating, hotter than any of those stifling kitchens ever could make you."

He steps closer to them, his tone growing more intense and persuasive.

Josef:
"And me? I’ll be your playwright. You know those stories we all have in us? The ones that nobody wants to hear because they’re too real, too raw? Well, I’ll give them voice. Together, we’ll turn this place into something more. Something that no one can ignore. Not even that kitchen."

The girls are quiet for a moment, taking in his words. For a brief second, there’s a hesitation in the air. The idea of breaking free, of stepping into something so much bigger, begins to take root in their minds. But it’s still a dangerous thought, uncertain.

Emilyn: (taking a step forward, eyes narrowed but intrigued)
"So what’s the catch, Josef? There’s always a catch. What’s your angle here?"

Josef: (smiling wryly, his voice lowering slightly)
"That’s the beauty of it, Em. No catch. Just a chance. A shot at something real, something huge. We’ll carve our own path, no one else will own our story."

He pauses, letting his words sink in.

Josef:
"Think about it. We’ve all been stuck. Trapped in these loops—endless cycles of frustration, exhaustion, and burnout. But I’m offering you an out. Not just another job, not just another paycheck… but a life where you control the narrative. Where you get to live your own movie. And I’ll be there, writing it all."

Karylca: (smirking with a raised eyebrow)
"A life as movie stars... and you’re the playwright? That’s your big plan?"

Josef: (shrugging nonchalantly)
"Yeah. What do you think? You’ve got the talent, the fire, and the rage that could make it work. Don’t you want to show the world who you really are? It’s all right here. The story, the stage, the lights. All we need is to take the first step."

Vikki: (looking up from her cup, considering it)
"And what happens if we fail? What if it all goes sideways?"

Josef:
"Then we’ll write another scene. Failure’s just part of the plot, Vikki. But we keep going. Because I believe in you all. We can make it work." (his eyes scan each of them, intense and sincere)
"You’re not just stuck in this office. You were born for something bigger. And I’m not taking no for an answer."

The air in the room is electric now—charged with a sense of possibility, uncertainty, and the power of what could be. For the first time, it feels like there’s a way out. A way forward. But will they take it?

The girls exchange glances, the weight of the decision heavy but thrilling.

Emilyn: (after a long beat, a small smile beginning to form)
"Alright, Josef. Let’s see where this takes us."

The camera pulls back as the tension dissolves into a sense of shared resolve. The girls nod, their minds made up. The journey to something new has begun. And as they follow Josef, they step into the unknown with a sense of freedom, power, and a burning desire to prove they are worthy of the roles they were born to play.

What direction do you think they’ll take next in their quest? Would you like to explore how they start their new journey or delve into their first big challenge?

Josef:  "and if for some reason it all goes side aways, there is always that GHETTO petting zoo down south we can hijack and make our own and sell Llama milk on the premium.

But I doubt that very much ladies that is our endgame, only a place we go out as an entourage to reminisicence on the past... maybe Give coins to a certain... 18th century woman named basheba? Come now ladies, Em, Karlyca, you have journeyed to far more fantastical scenarios than what I am proposing to you now."

Josef: (with a wide grin, his energy infectious)
"And if for some reason it all goes sideways, well, there’s always that GHETTO petting zoo down south we can hijack, make it our own, and sell Llama milk on the premium. We can even give the animals names, maybe? Who knows? But I highly doubt that’s going to be our endgame, ladies. That’s just a place where we go to reminisce on our glorious past. Maybe we’ll give coins to a certain... 18th-century woman named Bathsheba, huh? You know, honor her legacy, give her a little tribute, and laugh about the absurdity of it all."

He laughs, but it’s lighthearted, as if he knows exactly how crazy the idea sounds. His tone shifts back to earnestness as he continues.

Josef:
"Come now, ladies, Em, Karylca—you’ve journeyed to far more fantastical scenarios than what I’m proposing to you right now. Don’t you want to be part of something real, something more than just the grind? This could be your story. The one you’ll tell when you look back and say, 'That was when we made it.'"

He lets his words hang in the air, his confidence unwavering. The girls exchange glances, a spark of amusement flickering in their eyes, but there's also something else—curiosity. Could this mad idea really work?

Vikki: (laughing softly, shaking her head)
"Alright, alright, Llama milk and all. You really know how to sell a dream, Josef."

Karylca: (snorting with laughter, then smirking)
"I’m starting to think you’ve been planning this for a while, huh? The petting zoo and the premium milk… and Bathsheba. You are a strange one."

Josef grins even wider, the playful banter lighting up the room with a sense of camaraderie.

Josef:
"You know me too well, Karylca. But, seriously, this is our shot. The real shot. I don’t want to see you stuck in those dead-end jobs, feeling invisible. You deserve more than that. And yeah, if all else fails, we get llamas. But I'm betting we're going to hit it big. You don’t get to be stars without taking some risks, right?"

He stands up straighter, as if ready to march off into the unknown, leading them toward something bigger than they could ever imagine.

Emilyn: (smiling, her eyes glinting with newfound purpose)
"Alright, Josef. Llama milk or not... we’re in. But when we’re famous, I’m choosing the name for the llama."

Josef: (laughing)
"Deal, Em. You can name every llama we get. But we’re starting with this—together."

The energy in the room shifts, the earlier tension replaced with excitement, a sense of adventure, and the thrill of what lies ahead. For the first time, it feels like they’re all in it together, on the verge of something huge—something wildly unpredictable, but undeniably theirs.

How do you see their next steps unfolding? Would you like to dive into their first big move toward this new journey?
